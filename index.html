          Hey there, I am Pratyush a Whitehat Jr student and a tech enthusiast  and this is a mail regarding something that I think is very serious, first thing first I am not the one who tends to be wasting  my time waiting for any sort of clarifications in the future and  after reading this whole mess you might be thinking to have me a mail dropped saying that "Better luck next time" but I believe that if you are hungry today then you can't wait till tomorrow to get something to eat, so without wasting any much of yours time let's get started with the point.
        </p>
        
        <!--
            WHAT IS BRACKETS?
        -->
        <p>
            In the recent past Whitehat Jr has been one of the best ed-tech startups and it proved up to be a great Idea of our well known CEO of the company Mr Karan Bajaj and since the company has been providing high quality education to all the priors and teach them till they begin to be a masters, it's all well delivered, but apart from teaching the ed-tech startup has great virtues of motivating and overall development of  the students by having various championships and Hackathon and all of it paid off really good till today. 
        </p>

        <p>
        Here I am to let you know what goes backstage, So as the whole team knows that there was a Championship and a hackathon held In the last month which was a great success and I totally appreciate it but as the results came out on  13 October my mind was totally blown up,  not because I was not in the top 3 but because a great man said that "History Repeats Itself"  ,so let me now tell you about an very interesting incident which happened to me not very long, in June 2020.

            Once you're ready to get out of this sample project and edit your own code, you can use the dropdown
            in the left sidebar to switch folders. Right now, the dropdown says "Getting Started" - that's the
            folder containing the file you're looking at right now. Click on the dropdown and choose "Open Folderâ€¦"
            to open your own folder.
            You can also use the dropdown later to switch back to folders you've opened previously, including this
            sample project.

        <p>
          This all begin in the month of June when Whitehat Jr organized a contest <strong>(#WHJcodeWithDad)</strong> for making the best project in collaboration with our dad which fascinated me a lot, so I did my part, made a project and submitted it like any other student would have done  but now when the results came I was totally surprised when I didn't see my name in the top three which would make anyone furious who has worked 8-9 straight hours for five days, `What would anyone do now ??  Complain, fight, or just sit in a corner blaming himself for not being selected. Well, I went with the first option- Complaining and you won't believe happened when this issue went up to the team and after couple of days they said that "We are really sorry, we just missed your project, if we had seen it earlier you would have got the first position" and that's how they shut my mouth by giving me a statement of humanity and a $25 as the price for me to be silent.
        </p>
        
   
        
     
        
        <p>
           Let's now come back to the present  and as I have already  said that "History Repeats Itself", but what if someone doesn't want it to be, I was not in the top 3 in this championship which demotivated me a lot, because you can also imagine making a game in 4 hours with 5 screens and 3 game stages is not easy and I really don't want to say that I am the beat but I think I deserve It and if not I can openly challenge all the table toppers to have a mini championship for all 4 of us in any of the programming languages they are comfortable with where none of our projects gets missed out by the team and if my project wasn't deserving then please tell me what was the criteria, was it to make a replica of PUBG in 4 hours where instead of guns people would have sanitizers and enemies as the viruses and I tried to raise an complain against this but it was worthless, so  the one who is reading this is my last ray of hope to not to let the history repeat itself.
